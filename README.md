## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend

The backend of this application is built using Flask, with Flask-SQLAlchemy for interacting with the database. The database models include User, Post, and Comment, which are linked through one-to-many relationships. Passwords are securely hashed using Werkzeug for authentication.
